# Scanner-and-Parser
Scan in a json file and check if the file is valid. Then, parse the tokens to make sure the expected token is there.

This was a project given in my programming languages class. It was designed to test how well we understood scanner and parsers and what they consist of. The idea is to use the scanner to make sure the json file is valid and create tokens. Once that is determined, the parser is then called which iterates through the tokens and make sure they are used properly. It checks if the epected token is there (i.e. if there is a '{' then there needs to be a '}').
